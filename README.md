## About

This project aim to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches, including details about the launch site, landing outcomes, payload, and more. The dataset is available in [data.csv](data.csv).

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software/tools installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (for data analysis)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required Python packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Explore the dataset using Jupyter Notebook. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook to perform data analysis, visualize data, and gain insights from the SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data.

## Machine Learning

Build and train machine learning models to predict landing outcomes. The project uses various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, and k-Nearest Neighbors. Hyperparameter tuning is also performed to optimize model performance.

## Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of machine learning models using appropriate metrics. Compare and select the best model for predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landing outcomes.

## Usage

Explain how users can use the project for their own analysis or predictions. Provide instructions and examples if needed.
