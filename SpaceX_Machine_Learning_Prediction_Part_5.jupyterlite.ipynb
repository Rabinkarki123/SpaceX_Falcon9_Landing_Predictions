Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9b9e79e6-8497-49ce-b2e1-e914bf87726c","metadata":{},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/landing_1.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0fc39343-e511-4f02-aaaa-930eb60428d7","metadata":{},"source":["Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d8f06dd0-f33f-4d53-9a20-580a42011408","metadata":{},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/crash.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ef614108-fd8d-4344-948a-39d131d671df","metadata":{},"source":["Most unsuccessful landings are planed.

It's a crucial part of building effective machine learning models.\n","##### Overfitting :\n","Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data extremely well but fails to generalize to unseen data(test data)\n","##### Underfitting: \n","it occurs when the model can not generalize the testing result. mostly because of less amount of training data.\n","##### Regularization(c): Two common types of regularization are L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. They differ in the way they penalize the coefficients:\n","L1 regularization adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the loss function.\n","L2 regularization adds the squares of the coefficients to the loss function.\n","##### Penalty: L1/L2 \n","##### Solver: The \"solver\" is the optimization algorithm used to fit the logistic regression model to the training data. Logistic regression aims to find the best set of coefficients that minimizes a loss function.\n","Different solvers use different optimization techniques and may be more or less suitable for specific datasets or problem types.\n","'lbfgs' (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) is one of the optimization algorithms available for logistic regression.

It's another hyperparameter that can be tuned to optimize model performance.\n","##### Loss function: \n","The loss function is a critical component in training machine learning models, including logistic regression. It quantifies the difference between the predicted values (output of the model) and the actual target values in the training data. The goal during training is to minimize the loss function, which means making the model's predictions as close as possible to the true values. \n","#### Loss Function in Logistic Regression:\n","In logistic regression, the most common loss function is the logistic loss (or log loss) function, also known as the cross-entropy loss. The logistic loss is used when the target variable is binary (e.g., 0 or 1). It measures the error between the predicted probabilities and the true binary labels.\n","#### Formula: L(y, p) = -[y * log(p) + (1 - y) * log(1 - p)]\n","here , y is the true binary label (0 or 1) for the data point.\n","p is the predicted probability that the data point belongs to class 1.\n","The loss function penalizes the model more when it makes confident wrong predictions (i.e., when p is far from y).\n","\n","\n","#### Importance of the Loss Function:\n","\n","The loss function guides the model during training by providing feedback on how well it's doing.\n","Minimizing the loss function helps the model make more accurate predictions, especially for binary classification tasks.\n","The choice of the loss function can have a significant impact on model performance and the types of errors it makes.\n","\n","#### Grid Search: \n","Grid Search is a hyperparameter tuning technique used to systematically search for the best combination of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. It involves specifying a set of hyperparameters and their potential values, and then evaluating the model's performance for all possible combinations.\n","The primary use of Grid Search is to find the combination of hyperparameters that results in the best model performance, as measured by a chosen evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, or mean squared error).\n","\n","#### Cross-Validation (CV): \n","Grid Search often uses cross-validation to assess model performance. Cross-validation involves splitting the training data into multiple subsets (folds) and training and evaluating the model on each fold. The cv parameter in Grid Search specifies the number of cross-validation folds to use. Common values are 5 or 10.\n","\n","#### Hyperparameter Tuning: The GridSearchCV object, configured with a hyperparameter grid and a scoring metric, iteratively tests all possible combinations of hyperparameters on the training data using cross-validation.

SVM can use different kernels, and each kernel has its own hyperparameters. The common SVM kernels are:\n","\n","Linear: No additional hyperparameters.\n","RBF (Radial Basis Function): Requires a hyperparameter gamma.\n","Polynomial: Requires hyperparameters degree and coef0.\n","Sigmoid: Requires hyperparameters gamma and coef0.\n","#### Gamma (gamma): \n","The gamma hyperparameter is specific to the RBF kernel and controls the shape of the decision boundary. A small gamma results in a smoother, more flexible decision boundary, while a large gamma results in a more complex and tighter decision boundary.\n","#### Advantage of using polynomial kernel in a Support Vector Machine :\n","Flexibility: The polynomial kernel can capture more complex decision boundaries than the linear kernel. It allows the SVM to model non-linear relationships between features more effectively. This is particularly useful when the data is not linearly separable.\n","\n","Better Handling of Non-Linearity: When your data has non-linear patterns or clusters, the polynomial kernel can fit the decision boundary to the data's curvature. It can capture more intricate shapes, such as curves or loops, that a linear kernel cannot handle.\n","\n","Customizable Complexity: The polynomial kernel allows you to control the complexity of the decision boundary by adjusting the degree of the polynomial (a hyperparameter). A higher polynomial degree can result in a more complex boundary, while a lower degree results in a simpler one. This flexibility enables you to tailor the model to the specific complexity of your data.\n","\n","Feature Engineering: In some cases, the polynomial kernel can help avoid the need for extensive feature engineering. By increasing the polynomial degree, you can create higher-dimensional feature representations that can make previously inseparable data linearly separable.\n","\n","#### np.logspace(start, stop, num):\n","is a NumPy function that generates a sequence of numbers spaced evenly on a logarithmic scale. The parameters have the following meanings:\n","\n","start: The power of 10 for the first value in the sequence.\n","stop: The power of 10 for the last value in the sequence.\n","num: The number of values to generate in the sequence.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c6f9fa64-44d6-4472-8d1b-e859ad3308a4","metadata":{},"source":["Create a support vector machine object then  create a  <code>GridSearchCV</code> object  <code>svm_cv</code> with cv - 10.

In decision trees, two common criteria are 'gini' and 'entropy'. 'Gini' measures impurity based on the Gini impurity, while 'entropy' uses information gain based on the entropy of the target variable. You can choose one or both criteria to test which performs better for your problem.\n","\n","2. splitter:\n","The splitter hyperparameter determines the strategy used to choose the split at each node. You can choose between 'best' and 'random'. 'Best' selects the best split, while 'random' chooses a random split. It's often used to control overfitting by introducing randomness in the tree's construction.\n","\n","3. max_depth:\n","max_depth sets the maximum depth of the decision tree. A smaller value restricts the depth, which can prevent overfitting. The values in the list [2 * n for n in range(1, 10)] generate a range of depths from 2 to 18 (even numbers).\n","\n","4. max_features:\n","This hyperparameter determines the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. 'Auto' means all features, and 'sqrt' means the square root of the total number of features. It can help control the model's complexity and reduce overfitting.\n","\n","5. min_samples_leaf:\n","min_samples_leaf sets the minimum number of samples required to be in a leaf node. It can prevent the creation of very small leaf nodes, which may lead to overfitting. The values in the list [1, 2, 4] specify different minimum sample leaf sizes.\n","\n","6. bmin_samples_split:\n","min_samples_split sets the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. A smaller value may lead to more complex trees, while a larger value may simplify the tree structure.\n","\n","#### Entropy: \n","Entropy is a concept from information theory and statistics that measures the level of uncertainty, randomness, or disorder in a system. In the context of machine learning, entropy is often used in decision trees, particularly for the decision tree's splitting criterion.\n","\n","In the context of decision trees:\n","\n","Entropy measures the impurity or disorder of a set of data points (samples).\n","It quantifies how mixed the target variable's values are within a dataset.\n","Lower entropy indicates less disorder or impurity, while higher entropy suggests greater disorder.\n","Mathematically, the entropy of a set S with respect to a binary classification problem (e.g., binary outcome, e.g., 0 or 1) is calculated as:\n","Entropy(S) = -p1log2(p1)  -p2log2(p2)\n","where \n","p1 is the proportion of data points in class 1 (positive class).\n","p2 is the proportion of data points in class 2 (negative class).\n","The formula calculates the entropy by summing over the weighted information content of each class.\n","\n","When all data points in the set belong to a single class (i.e., \n","p1 = 1 or p2 = 1), the entropy is 0, indicating no disorder. When data points are evenly distributed between the two classes (i.e.p1=p2=0.5), the entropy is at its maximum, indicating maximum disorder.\n","In the context of decision tree splitting, the entropy is used to measure how well a particular split separates the data into subsets with less disorder (lower entropy). The goal is to find splits that minimize entropy, leading to more homogeneous subsets and better decision tree predictions."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":250,"id":"d85a7713-82bc-4857-9a18-56f2f425abcc","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Best Hyperparameters: {'criterion': 'gini', 'max_depth': 12, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'min_samples_leaf': 2, 'min_samples_split': 10, 'splitter': 'random'}\n","Best Score: 0.8767857142857143\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/Users/rabinkarki/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py:425: FitFailedWarning: \n","3240 fits failed out of a total of 6480.\n","The score on these train-test partitions for these parameters will be set to nan.\n","If these failures are not expected, you can try to debug them by setting error_score='raise'.\n","\n","Below are more details about the failures:\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","3240 fits failed with the following error:\n","Traceback (most recent call last):\n","  File \"/Users/rabinkarki/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/model_selection/_validation.py\", line 729, in _fit_and_score\n","    estimator.fit(X_train, y_train, **fit_params)\n","  File \"/Users/rabinkarki/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/base.py\", line 1145, in wrapper\n","    estimator._validate_params()\n","  File \"/Users/rabinkarki/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/base.py\", line 638, in _validate_params\n","    validate_parameter_constraints(\n","  File \"/Users/rabinkarki/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/utils/_param_validation.py\", line 96, in validate_parameter_constraints\n","    raise InvalidParameterError(\n","sklearn.utils._param_validation.InvalidParameterError: The 'max_features' parameter of DecisionTreeClassifier must be an int in the range [1, inf), a float in the range (0.0, 1.0], a str among {'log2', 'sqrt'} or None.
